All relevant infoFiles and experiment data for the project is stored in
experiments/innerSolarSystem.


For files describing initial conditions of bodies:
  experiments/innerSolarSystem/infoFiles/bodyInfo

For files describing experiment parameters:
  experiments/innerSolarSystem/infoFiles/experimentInfo




Which experiment is run is decided by appropriately (un)commenting
lines in main.py

  To spit out orbital periods and show a basic animation of inner planets:
    uncheck main.py line 13 "experimenter.innerSystem"

    file showing energy conservation is found in:
    experiments/innerSolarSystem/outputData/innerSystemEnergyConservation.dat

    file showing off general format of output data is found in:
    experiments/innerSolarSystem/outputData/innerBodyData1.dat


  To run mars satellite simulation:
    uncheck main.py line 14 "experimenter.satelliteToMars"

    This also spits out the closest approach to Mars.
    Note that the closest approach is not what I stated in the report!
    This is because I have set delta_t = 3000 (so it runs quickly)
    You can edit this by changing the file:
    experiments/innerSolarSystem/experimentInfo/marsSatelite and setting
    delta_t: 50

    You will also need to set
    animateEveryNth: 1800

    So the animation isn't super slow


  To see a random meteor animation and and for its closest approach to Earth:
    uncheck main.py line 16 "experimenter.meteorRisk"

    The meteor is black

    Note that the code used to calculate the approach of many meteors is
    commented out becuase that takes ages to run and isnt very exciting.





If you want to see an animation of x-z plane instead of x-y, change
AnimatedSystem.py line 42 from:

ypos = self.pastSysStates[frame][bodyIndex].pos[1]
to
ypos = self.pastSysStates[frame][bodyIndex].pos[2]

(especially interesting for mars satellite)
